Yeah, hi, this is just here because I wanted a collection of audios I could use in any and all HTML projects. Feel free to also use this, I guess. If you want to add sounds that's fine too, I suppose.
So, the way it works, you have to go use the format:
         audio src="https://thycitrus.github.io/Audio-Hosting/Mysterious Lights.mp3" controls></audio
Or whatever the equivalent is in whatever language you're using. This is an example in HTML, I'm doing that now, I decided.
